    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
      with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
       equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
      </p>

    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have 
      been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin 
      with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with
       a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously 
      violent instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
       and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and 
      irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
       the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.

          Reaching back across 13.8 billion years to the first sliver of cosmic time with telescopes at the 
          South Pole, a team of astronomers led by John M. Kovac of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for 
          Astrophysics detected ripples in the fabric of space-time — so-called gravitational waves — the 
          signature of a universe being wrenched violently apart when it was roughly a trillionth of a 
          trillionth of a trillionth of a second old. They are the long-sought smoking-gun evidence of inflation, 
          proof, Dr. Kovac and his colleagues say, that Dr. Guth was correct.
        </p>
        <p>
          Inflation has been the workhorse of cosmology for 35 years, though many, including 
          Dr. Guth, wondered whether it could ever be proved.
        </p>
        <p>
          If corroborated, Dr. Kovac’s work will stand as a landmark in science comparable 
          to the recent discovery of dark energy pushing the universe apart, or of the Big Bang itself. 
          It would open vast realms of time and space and energy to science and speculation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Confirming inflation would mean that the universe we see, extending 14 billion light-years in space 
          with its hundreds of billions of galaxies, is only an infinitesimal patch in a larger cosmos whose 
          extent, architecture and fate are unknowable. Moreover, beyond our own universe there might be an 
          endless number of other universes bubbling into frothy eternity, like a pot of pasta water boiling over.

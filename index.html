    <p>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — One night late in 1979, an itinerant young physicist named Alan Guth, 
      with a new son and a year’s appointment at Stanford, stayed up late with his notebook and
       equations, venturing far beyond the world of known physics.
      </p>

    <p>He was trying to understand why there was no trace of some exotic particles that should have 
      been created in the Big Bang. Instead he discovered what might have made the universe bang to begin 
      with. A potential hitch in the presumed course of cosmic evolution could have infused space itself with
       a special energy that exerted a repulsive force, causing the universe to swell faster than the speed of light for a prodigiously 
      violent instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      If true, the rapid engorgement would solve paradoxes like why the heavens look uniform from pole to pole
       and not like a jagged, warped mess. The enormous ballooning would iron out all the wrinkles and 
      irregularities. Those particles were not missing, but would be diluted beyond detection, like spit in the ocean.
    </p>
    <p>
      “SPECTACULAR REALIZATION,” Dr. Guth wrote across the top of the page and drew a double box around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday, Dr. Guth’s starship came in. Radio astronomers reported that they had seen the beginning of
       the Big Bang, and that his hypothesis, known undramatically as inflation, looked right.
